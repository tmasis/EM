# EM
Implementation of univariate EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures.

Takes 5 arguments: data file with the values to cluster, # of EM iterations, # of starting clusters, starting variance to be used for all the clusters, and real-valued parameter >= 0 that specifies how strongly the mixing parameters should be pushed toward the one best cluster
